# RectangleSearch

## Description
This program finds all rectangles that can be create from any given set of points. It should be noted that I got this problem this video https://youtu.be/EuPSibuIKIg and that this solution was not entirely my idea. Parts of this solution come from the dicussion in the video but I came up with a slightly different that I wanted to try out.
